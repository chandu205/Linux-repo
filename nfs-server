/share 192.168.87.158(rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)


/share – is the share folder which server wants to share
192.168.87.158 – is the IP address of the client to whom want to share
rw – This will all the clients to read and write the files to the share directory.
sync – which will confirm the shared directory once the changes are committed.
no_subtree_check – Will prevents the scanning the shared directory, as nfs performs the scans of every share directory, Disabling the subtree check will increase the reliability, but reduces the security.
no_root_squash – This will all the root user to connect to the designated directory.

Once, we enter the details of the share in config file, run the below command to export them
# exportfs -a

Configure Client
Install the required packages to connect to NFS

# yum install nfs-utils nfs-utils-lib -y


Creating Mount Point for Share Directory

# mkdir -p /mnt/share

Mounting the Share Directory
# mount 192.168.87.156:/share /mnt/share/


To confirm if the share is mounted or not run the command ‘df -h’, this will show the list of mounted folders
# df -h


To see the list of all the mounted file systems.
# mount

To Check the NFS Mount
Create a file and folders in the server share directory

# touch test1
# mkdir test
# ls /mnt/share/ -lh


To automatically mount the share folder permanently while boot in the client machine, add the entries in the /etc/fstab file
# vi /etc/fstab

This will show the available share on the local machine, so needed to run on the server side.

# showmount -e 192.168.87.156

List all the share files and folders with options on the server

# exportfs -u


This will un-export the shared folders or files which are in /etc/exports

# exports -r
