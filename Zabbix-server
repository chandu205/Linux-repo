Step 1: Install Apache Web Server and PHP

1. First, install Apache Web Server alongside with PHP and
its extensions in order to provide the web backed functionality for Zabbix Server by issuing the following command.

	# yum -y install epel-release
	# yum install httpd php php-mysql php-ldap php-bcmath- php-mbstring php-gd php-xml php-mcrypt.

2. Next, you need to tune PHP interpreter and adjust some values in order to run Zabbix Server. 
So, open Apache php.ini configuration file for editing by issuing the following command:

	# vi /etc/php.ini	

Now, search with CTRL+C and replace the following PHP values as it follows:

	max_execution_time 300
	memory_limit 128M
	always_populate_raw_post_data -1
	session.auto_start = 0
	mbstring.func_overload = 0
	date.timezone = Asia/kolkata


3. After updating PHP configuration file, restart Apache daemon to reflect changes by issuing the following command.

	# systemctl restart httpd.service		 [On RHEL/CentOS 7]


Step 2: Install MariaDB Database and Library

	# yum install mariadb-server mariadb-client mariadb-devel	         [On RHEL/CentOS 7]

5. When the installation of Mariadb finishes, secure the database by issuing mysql_secure_installation
command with system root privileges ( answer with yes for removing anonymous users, disable root login remotely,
removetest database and access to it and apply all changes).

	# mysql_secure_installation
6. The next requirement for Zabbix is setting-up a RDBMS database.
Log in to your LAMP stack database component (MySQL or MariaDB) and 
create a Zabbix database and the credentials required to manage the database, by issuing the following commands.
Make sure you replace database name, user and password to match your own settings.

	# mysql -u root -p
	MariaDB [(none)]> create database zabbixdb character set utf8 collate utf8_bin;
	MariaDB [(none)]> grant all privileges on zabbixdb.* to 'zabbixuser'@'localhost' identified by 'password1';
	MariaDB [(none)]> flush privileges;
	MariaDB [(none)]> exit


Step 3: Install Zabbix Server


	# rpm -ivh http://repo.zabbix.com/zabbix/3.4/rhel/7/x86_64/zabbix-release-3.4-2.el7.noarch.rpm
	# yum install zabbix-server-mysql zabbix-web-mysql

	# yum install zabbix-agent    [On RHEL/CentOS 7] 

	# systemctl restart httpd     [On RHEL/CentOS 7] 

Step 4: Configure Zabbix Server and Agent

	# zcat /usr/share/doc/zabbix-server-mysql/create.sql.gz | mysql -u zabbixuser zabbixdb -p


11. On the next step, setup Zabbix server by opening the main configuration file for editing with the following command.

	# nano /etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf

In zabbix_server.conf file search and modify the following lines as presented in the below excerpt. Update the variables to reflect your own database settings.

	DBHost=localhost
	DBName=zabbixdb
	DBUser=zabbixuser
	DBPassword=password1

12. Finally, save and close Zabbix server configuration file by pressing Ctrl+o and Ctrl+x file and restart Zabbix daemon to apply changes by issuing the below command.

	# systemctl restart zabbix-server.service

13. Next, configure Zabbix Agent configuration file by updating the following lines. First, open the file for editing.

	# nano /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.conf 

Zabbix agent configuration file excerpt:

	Server=127.0.0.1
	ListenPort=10050

14. Save and close Zabbix agent configuration file and restart Zabbix Agent to reflect changes
by issuing the following command.
	
	# systemctl restart zabbix-agent.service 

Step 5: Install and Configure Zabbix Frontend Interface
15. Now itâ€™s time to install Zabbix Server Frontend web interface.
In order to accomplish this step open a browser and navigate to your server IP Address
using HTTP or HTTPS protocol and the welcome screen should appear. Hit the Next button to move forward.

	http://192.168.1.*/zabbix/setup.php ( mention your System IP  Adress here to load zabbix server)
	OR
	https://192.168.1.*/zabbix/setup.php
